Personal news scraper using python3 and various modules, the software is created in educational and practical purposes, it uses various python modules but the backbone consists of bs4 and requests modules. Anyone that is using this sort of software on pages of their choosing should check for any signs that the page author does not agree with the public scraping their page. I have added this 
program as an alias on my system. news=/pathtofile/webscrape.py
If any authors of the webpages I am scraping but have missed the info in their robot.txt please let me know and I will stop doing so.
